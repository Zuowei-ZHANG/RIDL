# The Representation of Imprecision in Deep Learning techniques(RIDL)
This is the supplementary of RIDL for the paper ["Representation of Imprecision in Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification"].


Folder `Detailed_examples_of_manually_report`: We reported the label correction of training images on different dataset in detail. NI represent the number of initial uncertainty samples that Identified by the first step of RIDL. NF represent the number of final uncertainty samples that manually corrected by human annotators. NM represent the number of manually corrected samples. Here are the detailed examples.

File `per_class_confusion_matrix.xlsx`: We counted the confusion matrices for all results and provide a detailed per-class analysis data in folder `per_class_confusion_matrix`.

<!--We sincerely hope that our revised manuscript is now suitable for publication and that it will interest the readers of IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.-->
